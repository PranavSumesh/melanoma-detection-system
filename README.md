# Melanoma Detection System

The aim of this project is to create an automated melanoma detection system utilizing digital image processing and machine learning. 
Following the segmentation of the provided dermoscopic pictures, the damaged skin cells' features are extracted using a feature extraction technique. 
The stratification of the extracted features is done using a convolutional neural network classifier.
The system will be able to identify any early melanoma symptoms, so that the user can immediately address the issue before the cancer cells multiply rapidly.
