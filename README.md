# **Melanoma Detection System**

- The aim of this project is to create an automated melanoma detection system utilizing digital image processing and machine learning. 
- Following the segmentation of the provided dermoscopic pictures, the damaged skin cells' features are extracted using a feature extraction technique. 
- The stratification of the extracted features is done using a convolutional neural network classifier.
- The system will be able to identify any early melanoma symptoms, so that the user can immediately address the issue before the cancer cells multiply rapidly.
